H is registered with Companies House, London as Holmsley Ltd., with company number 11742386.  </p><p class="paragraph">Holmsley chooses to remain resilient and open to all investors, with no maximum or minimum investment amount. The ForEx market produces 480 billion dollars annually and is fertile ground for superior services. H is presently open to investment into a final prototype version of its trading fund, where previous trading performance was based on 2.4% of the fund being placed at risk on each trade producing high risk, and high returns of 79.6% per annum. The low risk medium returns product limits risk to 0.6 percent of the fund per trade, with projected returns of 22.4% per annum. </p><p class="paragraph">The Company is also tending for £67,800 of startup investment to fund its regulatory compliance, and an autonomous client facing internet site capable of marketing our services, opening new accounts, receiving deposits and updating balances daily. </p><p class="paragraph">The visionary founders of Holmsley are Christopher Burton and Daniel Wareham.They are the owners as well as the direct management team overseeing the day-to-day operations, evaluating success metrics and directing personnel. They have specialties in leadership and advanced analytic skills. They also come with direct longitudinal experience of the ForEx markets.Their ability to oversee and direct efforts is exemplified in their peerless track record in the ForEx markets</p><p class="paragraph">The current expected growth of the low risk proptype fund ranges from 12.1% to 36.9%. With previous high risk trading producing returns averaged at 79.6% per annum with monthly highs at 22.7% and lows at 12.5%. Their consistent success is due to their unique management and decision-making process governing investment dynamics. Without giving away the secret sauce, this success is contingent upon market analysis, the ability to move quickly, unique access to relevant information sources, and constant tracking of market trends.</p><p class="paragraph">The first portion of growth each month will be returned to investors, to deliver 22.4% return on investment over the whole year, with any excess trading output being returned to Holmsley to provide for the provision of its services to its clients. This system will ensure maximum returns to our clients, and provide a profit motive for H to exceed expectations and deliver exceptional fund performance and value to its investors. </p><p class="paragraph">In addition to a superior financial operating model, Holmsley also created a business philosophy of transparency and timely updates for its investors.Investors are able to seetheir successes in almost real-time, with updates being delivered on the last weekend of each month. Furthermore, monthly reports will tell investors how much their investment has grown by amount (£) and by percentage, alongside what percentage of the total investment fund they own, and too, the total value of the investment fund. All this information will be made available through the Google Drive file sharing platform.</p><p class="paragraph">On the receipt of sufficient startup capital this monthly Company Ledger update system will be replaced with an autonomous online portal for daily updates on client balances, alongside a host of autonomous services, including, client account setup, deposit services and digital marketing services. </p><p class="paragraph">Holmsley also prides itself on its unique and strategic relationships among the senior management of major Banks, hedge funds, and a wide range of experts from across the financial services sector. Networking, and relationship maintenance are at the heart of Holmsley’s practices and will be key to ensuring the right advice guides our business, and grows your investment. </p><p class="paragraph">Holmsley brings its superior service, transparency, expertise, and financial success to its investors in pursuit of its ongoing vision to provide the best quality of service in the ForEx investment sector, create wealth for its investors, and become the gold standard of ForEx investment in the future. </p>');
