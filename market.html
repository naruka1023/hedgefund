Proudly delivering the first 5 percent of fund growth each month to our investors free of any commissions or charges. With annual return on investment projected at 79.6 percent, and no minimum investment amounts, we are delighted to open our door to all. </p><p class="paragraph">Targeted at the high risk, high return market segment, our product is suitable for investors with established portfolios looking to take on higher risk and returns with a portion of their funds. The product also suits ordinary novice investors, comfortable with risks and looking to make the significant gains usually denied them by the minimum investment amounts on other professionally managed trading funds. H will democratise wealth creation, shifting it from the hands of a very few, and deliver it to a great many. </p><p class="paragraph">Homsley will continue to grow, and develop the capacity to offer a wide range of products that vary in their risks and returns. H will work closely with independent financial advisors to offer complete portfolio offerings with no minimum investment terms, offering the security, and profitability so that both ordinary people and the very wealthy can enjoy real choice in their investments.</p> <p class="paragraph"><i>ForEx vs. Stock Investments.</i> The Foreign Exchange Market is subject to the upheavals that affect stocks and share prices. The currencies of each state effectively act as indices for the total productivity of that state, whereas Company Stocks can be considerably more volatile as news breaks about changes in the fortunes of that entity, Currency Markets are relatively more stable. The other significant advantage of H trading currencies over stocks is that once one owns a stock, one also owns a weighted financial obligation to service the debts of the Company in which that stock was purchased  in the case of that Companies insolvency that liability could become considerable. Currency markets have no risk of this nature attached to them. Accordingly, in stock trading one could end up owing more money than they deposited, whereas in currency trading it is not possible to lose a greater amount of money than was deposited. These factors culminate in giving H advantage over stock trading businesses, in greater stability in the markets being traded, and a greater capacity to limit losses.</p> <br><p style=\'padding: 10px 0; border-bottom: solid gray 1px; border-top: solid gray 1px;\'><i>Footnote. *Based on detailed search for investment products on google, using search term \'investment high return\' and checking the results back to the 125th page</i></p>');

							$('.details-page-content').html('<h2 class=\'main-title\'>Key Advantages</h2><p class="paragraph">Various factors are culminating to make this a uniquely opportune time for a venture like Holmsley Ltd. to emerge into the market. H is founded as a Limited Company and as such is its own independent entity. H is subject to the rule of British CompanyLaw,andthe regulatory authority of the Financial Conduct Authority, London. Bank of England base rates, and interest on consumer savings and investment products have been stagnating around 1.5 percent since a disastrous financial year in 2007. A decade of appallingly low returns on investments for ordinary savers coupled with the wealthiest over 50\'s England has ever seen. Enriched by property values soaring over the last 4 decades, and an increasing willingness of investors to seek novel investment strategies to maximise their retirement incomes. His well placed to access this group through entering into arrangements with the independent financial advisors that shepherd the bulk of their capital. Young workers of previous generations set money aside for deposits on their mortgages to become homeowners. With house prices risen so sharply over 4 decades home ownership is out of reach for almost all young people, including those with traditional professions and good incomes. This generation of potential investors are the most cash rich of any generation of 25 to 35-year-olds Britain has ever recorded, with 5 times the disposable income of their grandparents at the same ages. Knowing that youth correlates with risk-taking behaviours,it would seem sensible to suggest that a high-risk, high-return product without minimum investment limits will be very popular with this cash rich demographic as they search for financial security in a market that has deprived them of homeownership and acceptable returns from conventional investments with High Street banks.</p>');

							$('.details-page-content').html('<h2 class=\'main-title\'>Protecting your Investment</h2><p class="paragraph">Holmsleyâ€™s trading partners have greater than 10 years combined training experience and have been professionally trained by the highly reputable AstroFx. Their experience, market acumen and training provide the basis of their ability to deliver consistent,high-yield profits. Their trading strategy has been proven to produce detailed projections for the Market. Part of that strategy includes adhering to proven fundamentals, constant monitoring of relevant news sources, and peerless knowledge and experience of market behaviours. </p><p class="paragraph">When trading with any sum of capital, be it large or small, the aim is to limit losses to the utmost, and ensure growth. This is achieved in a number of ways such that loss making trades are closed with the use of a trading device called a â€˜stop-lossâ€™, which limits losses and automatically drops purchases that are losing money for our fund. A similar trading mechanism will be set to automatically sell our market positions for a profit.The knowledge of where to place these two mechanisms, one for stopping losses, the other for securing profits, alongside the crucial knowledge of when to place money onto the market and correctly determine the direction of that position,is the vast wealth of knowledge acquired by our trading pair over 15 years of combined trading experience. Our trading pair use arange of statistical and analytic tools,alongside formidable market knowledge when trading to identify a worthwhile trade or to avoid trading that day altogether. Therefore, achieving our ultimate goal of protecting and growing our investors capital appears a sensible progression from an already formidable record of making returns on investment.</p><p class="paragraph">In producing 79.6% returns last year H used leverage of 1:200 and lot sizes and stop losses that risked 2.4% of the total fund in each trade on average.This approach allowed for very high returns through the year, it also exposed investment capital to significant risk, largely mitigated through superior trading insights and knowledge within the team. In bringing a new product to market ,H will make this investment more secure for its customers. Lowering leverage to 1:3, and lot sizes and stop losses exposing just 0.6% of the fund in each trade. These changes effectively mean that less of the investment fund is at risk at any given time so that, in the case of anything unexpected losses will be reduced by a factor of 5.This additional risk mitigation is projected to reduce returns from 79.6% to 24.6%. In the knowledge that H produced very high rates of return, when risks were high, continuing to enjoy success at a lower risk profile is surely a reliable prospect. </p> <h3 style=\'margin-top:20px; padding-top:20px; border-top:solid gray 1px\'>Contingency plans for operational failure</h3><p class="paragraph">	Possible operational failure scenarios include.	<ol type="1">		<li>Trading staff returning unsatisfactory results </li>		<li>The death, infirmity, or retirement of multiple operation critical staffing </li>		<li>Cash-flow shortfalls</li>		<li>Inadequate profits to reasonably service stakeholders being remunerated by profit share </li>	</ol>	Mitigation protocols	<ol type=\'1\'>		<li>A few solutions are available.			<ol type=\'a\'>				<li>Accessing our brokerage, and using them as a portal to access the best performing of the traders on their platform to offer them work in trading our Company fund. </li>				<li>Offering investment fund Clients the option to convert their investment in the fund, into a secured loan to the company on the terms of our â€˜secured loan agreementâ€™ to expedite the development of our Company from a Foreign Exchange investment entity, to a fully licenced Hedge-Fund at which point we can then place investments with other providers with returns geared to risk at rates of return from 8-32% return per annum. examples.					<ol type=\'i\'>						<li>Tan Ridge Capital, Hedge-Fund, guaranteed bond coupons valid for 8% returns per annum.</li>						<li>Insurance Re-investment Bonds, geared to risk returning upto 32% per annum on average.  </li>					</ol>				</li>			</ol>		</li>		<li>Various personnel risk mitigation procedures			<ol type=\'a\'>				<li>Standard risk mitigation, for trading fund value of Â£10,000,000 to Â£100,000,000. 					<ol type=\'i\'>						<li>Rules that prevent Directors from international travel to developing or â€˜riskyâ€™ environments without seeking a risk assessment from the Operations Director </li>						<li>Rules that require Directors to seek 6 monthly medical consultations and be bound by their doctors advice to maintain good health and report any news to the Operations Director </li>						<li>Rules that require Directors to report any threat, or perceived threat to their safety, and to declare any facet of their personal life that could be used to control them by means of extortion or manipulation to the detriment of the Company. </li>					</ol>				</li>				<li>Fund value of Â£100,000,000,000 or more. 					<ol type=\'i\'>							<li>Rules that forbid more than one Director to share a form of transport, be it car, airplane, or boat ect.
